# Bitcoin Price Changes on Twitter

## Introduction

In this project, we extract and analyze social sentiment from two of the largest Social Media sites, Reddit and Twitter. By comparing the ups and down trends of social media sentiment, we hope that this analysis will help us better understand how social media has affected, influenced, or maybe even exaggerated price changes through positive or negative sentiment. 

### Research Questions

* Is bitcoin price change reactionary or independent of media sentiment?
* How accurate is Twitter sentiment in predicting or interpreting bitcoin price changes?
Are users posting more frequently when there is a major change in price?
